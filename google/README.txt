If you're going to try to include tones and you have as bad as memory as me, I personally really liked having the Pinyin with the accent marks to indicate the tones while I read.

So you could go through and copy the doc over and do find and replace for all the names and such and such. However, I uhhh, find that pretty boring and I don't particularly want to do that esp when there are so many things to replace. So I wrote a script that will do that for me! It works in google documents and I'll walk you through how to use it.

Keeping in mind, how these script work (unless you publish them) will be on a per document basis. So you'll have to follow these steps for each doc you want to add this functionality to (unless you reuse the same doc for all the fics your recording).

1) Copy the fic text over into a google doc
2) Go to Tools -> Script Editor
3) This should pop open a new Script Editor Window
4) Copy in the code from here: pinyinScript.txt
5) Paste and save save it in the script editor (it will prompt you to name it):
6) Try to run the new onOpen function (this is what is creating the menu option)
7) Grant permissions for the script to access the document (else it can't modify it)
8) go back to original document and select the new menu option
9) wait for the script to run and tada! The document now has the tonal accents
